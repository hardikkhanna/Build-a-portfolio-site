                    <h4 class="big text-center"> Hi! I am Hardik khanna, a Certified Personal Trainer and Nutrition Counselor. My days are happily spent teaching people how to exercise properly and develop individualized nutrition programs. The goal is to improve the health of my clients through prevention and education which will result in a longer, healthier life. I first got involved with bodybuilding and fitness when, as a youngster, doctors forbade me to participate in contact sports such as hockey, baseball, football and basketball. (Each of which, I might add, I play well!)

Greg Rando at International Federation of Bodybuilders competition In addition to all of this I began to compete in bodybuilding in 1992 and since then have been able to achieve four National Championships, plus I had the honor of representing the USA at the 54th World Bodybuilding Championship in Malaysia, placing in the top ten. Not being able to see in a sport renowned for athletes' detailed chiseling of fully developed muscles, I don't think that anyone has missed this pumping "irony."

My clients are scheduled Monday through Friday for 30 to 60 minute sessions. I usually work from 6am to 7pm — with breaks scheduled throughout the day — instructing and motivating each one individually. Their customized fitness program helps them to achieve their fitness goals. The fact that my clients, who are training to achieve their health goals, are both male and female and cover all age demographics and physical abilities, makes my job all the more interesting, challenging and rewarding.

For the last 10 years I owned and operated a small business in Stoneham, Massachusetts, called Boston Nutrition & Strength Center, where I built up a large personal training clientele. About the time my lease on the building was up for renewal I received an offer to sell the business at a good profit, so I decided to sell and move my business to a local gym where I continue to build even more new clientele. One of the benefits of being a personal trainer is you can be your own boss. Although I work for myself, as I mentioned, I do it out of a local health club where interacting with the club's faculty is an important aspect of my job. These people are generally positive, self-confident and promote good health.

My current job as a personal trainer is quite different from other jobs I've had. For example, while growing up I had jobs like selling audio-visual equipment, household appliances and furniture. Overall, these earlier experiences provided very valuable growth and development of skills that have heightened my success as a personal trainer. A case in point: the communication skills I needed and developed as a salesperson have served me well in training my clients.

While designing and owning my own health club, I was able to take some important things into consideration, such as having a moderate size space with good lighting, bold contrast between the equipment and floor and making sure things are kept in order. Some of the pros to owning my own business were that I could be my own boss, set my own schedule, customize my surroundings the way I wanted them, and everyone who patronized the club knew of my disability and there were no problems.

                       This workout plan is designed to help you shred fat and get in shape in only 12 weeks. This might sound like hype, but it's not. The following plan is not easy. It starts slowly, but builds rapidly.

Every detail of your diet and training for the next 12 weeks will be laid out for you. You will be told exactly what to eat, how much cardio to do, and how to weight train.

The goal is simple: lose fat, maintain muscle mass, get in shape and transform your physique as much as possible over the next 3 months. You want to not only look better, but have the fitness level and strength to match your new body.
12 Week Program Expectations

Over the next 12 weeks your goals and expectations are:

    Fat Loss - To lose at least 10 pounds of fat.
    Muscle Mass - To maintain, or even gain lean muscle mass.
    Conditioning - To be in amazing shape; perhaps the best shape in years.

The 12 Week Diet Plan

Each week will consist of 3 different types of eating days.
<ol>
    <li>High Carb Days - 1 day per week</li>
    <li>Moderate Carb Days - 3 days per week</li>
    <li>Low Carb Days - 3 days per week</li>
                    </ol>
You may structure these days in any preferred manner. I suggest keeping the high carb day for special occasions. That way you can attend family functions, or eat out with friends, and indulge a little more than normal.

It should be noted that calorie intake can be adjusted based on metabolism. The follow changes are recommended:
<ol>
    <li>Men 40+ - Reduce daily calories by 300.</li>
    <li>Men 20-25 - Increase daily calories by 300.</li>

    <li>Women 40+ - Reduce daily calories by 200.</li>
    <li>Women 20-25 - Increase daily calories by 200.</li>
                    </ol>
12 Week Eating Plan for Men
<ul>
    <li>   Week 1 - 3 low carb days with 2300 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2400 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.</li>
    <li>  Week 2 - 3 low carb days with 2200 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2400 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.</li>
    <li>Week 3 - 3 low carb days with 2100 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2400 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.</li>
    <li>Week 4 - 3 low carb days with 2000 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2400 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.</li>
    <li>Week 5 - 3 low carb days with 2300 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2300 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.</li>
    <li>Week 6 - 3 low carb days with 2200 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2300 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.</li>
    <li>Week 7 - 3 low carb days with 2100 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2300 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.</li>
    <li>Week 8 - 3 low carb days with 2000 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2300 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.</li>
    <li>Week 9 - 3 low carb days with 2300 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2200 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.</li>
    <li>Week 10 - 3 low carb days with 2200 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2200 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.</li>
    <li>Week 11 - 3 low carb days with 2100 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2200 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.</li>
    <li>Week 12 - 3 low carb days with 2000 calories, 3 moderate carbs days with 2200 calories, 1 high carb day of 2700 calories.</li>
                    </ul>
Protein intake should be a minimum of 180 grams per day. If you are a bigger guy, or have a fair amount of muscle mass, then eat 200 to 220 grams of protein per day. If you eat a little more protein the drop your daily fat intake to make up for the calories.

Fat intake should be approximately 20-30% of your daily calories. Once you have determined your daily calories from proteins and fats, fill in your eating plan with carbohydrates.

Also, you are allowed up to 10% of your daily calories from dirty foods/junk foods. You do not have to eat any junk if you prefer. This option exists as a convenience, should you be battling a craving, or attending a social gathering where you would prefer to have a small snack.

Fat intake should be approximately 20-30% of your daily calories. Once you have determined your daily calories from proteins and fats, fill in your eating plan with carbohydrates.

The 12 Week Cardio Plan

It doesn't matter which form of cardio you use for these 12 weeks. Pick something that gets your heart moving, be it treadmill, elliptical, or swimming.

The first thing you will notice about this cardio plan is that it starts slow. That's ok. Right now you are out of shape. This program is designed to get you in shape over the course of 12 weeks.

Be patient. Trust the plan and stick to the plan. After the end of 12 weeks your level of conditioning may surprise you.

                        This simple swarm script with GUI interface was written in Processing about 5 years ago.
                        Now I figure out lots of code from this script should be improved! For instance, we can implement KDTree later...

                        The Digital Lamp of Architecture referred to John Ruskin's book
                        "The Seven Lamps of Architecture, " and make a comparison between its age
                        and our digital age. Through traveling, description in theory can be highly
                        discovered within backpacker's own eye. Finally, digital technology was implanted
                        into church architecture as an example to reflect on Ruskin's theory. One of the
                        most important element is "Sublime." Besides, scale, structure and ornamentation
                        was used to interpret and practice in Digital Architecture.

                        You are going to want to start with your protein and fat. Set your protein and fat, spread throughout 5-6 meals. I would recommend for most as a generic outline 1.5g per pound of bodyweight per day of protein and about 60-120 grams of fat, or 5-15 grams of fat per meal over 5-6 meals. This will have PWO carbs included and zero other carbs throughout the day.

For a male, it might look like this:
                        <ol >
                            <li>Meal 1 - 42 grams protein, 15 grams Fat</li>
                            <li>Meal 2 - 42 grams protein, 15 grams Fat</li>
                            <li>Meal 3 - 42 grams protein, 15 grams Fat</li>
                            <li>Meal 4 PWO - 42 grams protein, 15 grams Fat, 60 grams carbs</li>
                            <li>Meal 5 - 42 grams protein, 15 grams Fat</li></ol>
We will then add carbs into meal 1 once a sticking point (no CLEAN weight GAIN) is reached. It will look like this:
                            <ol><li>Meal 1 - 42 grams protein, 15 grams Fat, 60 grams Carbs</li>
                            <li>Meal 2 - 42 grams protein, 15 grams Fat</li>
                            <li>Meal 3 - 42 grams protein, 15 grams Fat</li>
                            <li>Meal 4 PWO - 42 grams protein, 15 grams Fat, 60 grams carbs</li>
                            <li>Meal 5 - 42 grams protein, 15 grams Fat</li>
                    </ol><br>
